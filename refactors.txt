- Read and write database for each piece of data that system is storing

- CLI to interact with booking system

- Include more functionality for the hotel class - what other things might hotel want to do (give out keys, reserve conference rooms, store employee information, etc.)

- More testing around edge cases

- Better testing - more examples used when testing/generate random data each run

- More efficient searching

- Smaller methods

- Breaking out booking room block into its own class

- Futher consideration for edge cases

- Use modules as a namespace

- Abstract naming so can better be used for more purposes than hotel
